1. **What is eCPM?**<br/>
   eCPM, Effective Cost Per Mille, is a metric used to measure the estimated earnings of an ad per 1000 impressions.<br/>
   The formula to calculate eCPM is: _eCPM_ = (Total Ad Earnings / Impressions) * 1000.<br/>
   For example, if an ad generates $100 from 50,000 impressions, the eCPM = $2.<br/>

2. **What are the metrics for a healthy mobile game? Which metrics do you think are the most important?**<br/>
   Here are some essential metrics for a mobile game:
   - **Daily Active User (DAU), Monthly Active User (MAU)**: Tracks the number of users playing the game daily and monthly.
   - **Retention Rate**: Measures how many players return to the game after their first session (e.g., week-1, month-1 retention rate).
   - **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: Calculates the average revenue generated per user.
   - **Churn Rate**: Measures the percentage of players who stop playing the game over a session.

   All of the above metrics are important, but some stand out more depending on the game's goals:
   - **Retention Rate (RR)**: High RR indicates players enjoy the game and are likely to keep playing.
   - **DAU & MAU**: High active user numbers suggest the game is engaging and popular.

3. **How to monetize a free game?**<br/>
   A free game, meaning free-to-play (F2P), can be monetized through various strategies:
   - **Advertisements**: Display ads and rewarded video ads. Ads can be shown between levels or as optional rewards for players.
   - **In-App Purchases (IAP)**: Players can buy virtual goods, costumes, power-ups to enhance their gameplay experience.
   - **Premium Upgrades**: Offering premium features or content for a one-time purchase (e.g., VIP1 to VIP10 in some games).

   By combining these strategies, developers can create a balanced monetization approach that maximizes revenue while maintaining a positive player experience.
