### Case Study 1:
  1. All users in Russia and using Android devices are playing the game with version 1.5.2.
  2. Imagine you are a LiveOps team member and after working on data of game version 1.5.2, you found that the tutorial
  was not good for the users experience.
  3. Hence, you decided you would roll out a new version 1.6.0 to change the Tutorial in-game and you expected this
  would help increase user experience.
